# DurangoSimulator
 Durango emulation software
# What is a durango, and why would you want to simulate him?
 Durango Simulation is vital to the survival of mankind or something i have no idea
# Okay, but seriously, why open source this now?
 I had always planned to open source the game a year after release to let people explore the files and whatnot to make modding easier for anyone who would be insane enough to actually want to do that. Unfortunately, I never finished this and am only releasing this so that someone could maybe get some use out of it! Sorry guys, it just isn't happening. Game's cancelled
# How do i compile this
 I'll be honest I can't even guarantee this will compile whatsoever. If it does, excellent! The older my source gets the more likely it isn't gonna compile which freaking sucks.
